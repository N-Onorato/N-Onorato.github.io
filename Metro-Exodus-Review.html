<p>I recently finished playing Metro Exodus by 4A Games and I had a good time but wanted to share my thoughts. Like the other Metro games 4A Games continue to capture the atmosphere of a decaying russian world trying to cling to life after a nuclear apocalypse.</p>
<p>As the title would suggest the game is centered around an exodus of it's most familiar setting. No longer are you exploring Moscow's underground, instead you're on the surface trying to find a new home. This story is where Metro shines because the gameplay, while engaging, is best described as serviceable.</p>
<p>The heart of the game is its extremely detailed environments, characters, notes, and audio tracks. Considering the 20-24 hour campaign the amount of voice work done is incredible. There are multiple instances where you can sit around for 30 minutes and listen to a scene take place where characters have conversations and develop themselves. Sometimes the dialogue can be somewhat overbearing because I didn't want to listen to 20 minutes of exposition. But that's ok, the dialogue isn't essential, if its not interesting then you can usually leave the encounter. </p>
<p>The only real weak point is the gameplay, which suffers from a lack of choice. Nearly every engagement starts with stealth. Which has ok mechanics but isn't extremely fun. After playing games like Dishonored and Hitman it's clear that choice makes stealth much more fun. The ability to climb environments, hide bodies, and wear disguises makes the game more fun. These mechanics are sadly missing in Metro Exodus, which seems to push stealth pretty strongly but only allows you to crouch, takedown enemies, and throw objects to distract enemies. This works, but makes each encounter more like a slow simple puzzle of you evading enemies or killing them from a distance.</p>
<p>Often stealth will fail as you'll be found and then you'll kill everyone following the typical FPS pattern of shooting and ducking. One interesting mechanic they aded is that if you do well enemies will give up and put their hands up. You can then knock them out or kill them. This only affects humans, mutants once hostile will usually always attack to the end.</p>
<p>These combat encounters aren't bad, they are entertaining and fun. But if there were more options during stealth allowing you to change disguises and explore more intricate environments it would be more fun. I don't think the other combat could be made more fun without increasing the difficulty, which is an option as I played on normal but more difficult options exist that make the enemies smarter and force you to be more conservative with your ammo.</p>
<p>Overall, I would recommend people play the game because the characters are interesting and the story is good. I think 4A games deserves support for the amazing work they do. </p>
