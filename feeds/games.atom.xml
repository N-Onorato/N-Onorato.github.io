&lt;p&gt;I recently finished playing Metro Exodus by 4A Games and I had a good time but wanted to share my thoughts. Like the other Metro games 4A Games continue to capture the atmosphere of a decaying russian world trying to cling to life after a nuclear apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title would suggest the game is centered around an exodus of it's most familiar setting. No longer are you exploring Moscow's underground, instead you're on the surface trying to find a new home. This story is where Metro shines because the gameplay, while engaging, is best described as serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the game is its extremely detailed environments, characters, notes, and audio tracks. Considering the 20-24 hour campaign the amount of voice work done is incredible. There are multiple instances where you can sit around for 30 minutes and listen to a scene take place where characters have conversations and develop themselves. Sometimes the dialogue can be somewhat overbearing because I didn't want to listen to 20 minutes of exposition. But that's ok, the dialogue isn't essential, if its not interesting then you can usually leave the encounter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real weak point is the gameplay, which suffers from a lack of choice. Nearly every engagement starts with stealth. Which has ok mechanics but isn't extremely fun. After playing games like Dishonored and Hitman it's clear that choice makes stealth much more fun. The ability to climb environments, hide bodies, and wear disguises makes the game more fun. These mechanics are sadly missing in Metro Exodus, which seems to push stealth pretty strongly but only allows you to crouch, takedown enemies, and throw objects to distract enemies. This works, but makes each encounter more like a slow simple puzzle of you evading enemies or killing them from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often stealth will fail as you'll be found and then you'll kill everyone following the typical FPS pattern of shooting and ducking. One interesting mechanic they aded is that if you do well enemies will give up and put their hands up. You can then knock them out or kill them. This only affects humans, mutants once hostile will usually always attack to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These combat encounters aren't bad, they are entertaining and fun. But if there were more options during stealth allowing you to change disguises and explore more intricate environments it would be more fun. I don't think the other combat could be made more fun without increasing the difficulty, which is an option as I played on normal but more difficult options exist that make the enemies smarter and force you to be more conservative with your ammo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I would recommend people play the game because the characters are interesting and the story is good. I think 4A games deserves support for the amazing work they do. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering Arkane</title><link href="n-onorato.github.io%5CArkane-Studios-Is-Cool.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-11T11:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-06-11T11:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Nicholas Onorato</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-06-11:n-onorato.github.io\Arkane-Studios-Is-Cool.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I played through Prey (2017) twice and watched my SO play through it once.

It's obvious that I love the game and when a game has such an impact I like to examine who made it. As it turns out Arkane Studios, the creator of prey is also the studio behind many other games I've enjoyed such as the games in the Dishonored series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People refer to their games as &lt;a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/immersive-sim/3015-5700/"&gt;immersive sims&lt;/a&gt; which define the goals of the game. Typically these games emphasize variety in choice, story telling, and interaction. One reason I love Arkane's games is the varety of their world building. Here's a list of all the ways they build up a world from the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text logs found throughout the world, ranging from stories, poems, and any other things that might be written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio logs which are usually used for story exposition but also character building and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common conversations between NPCs can often be interesting and give interesting info about the world of their disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall environment also tells a lot about the world. Including things like graffiti and NPCs routine animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area Arkane Studios hasn't explored too deeply is in the area of video. This makes sense as it's more work and if things change it's easier to re-record some audio or change some text. But I do remember them included 2 stylized "found footage" videos in Prey which added a fun sense of depth to the info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that being immersive sims are just a style of game. The real success is in Arkane being able to design and execute that style with a compelling story and refined gameplay. If you haven't played Dishonored or Prey I would suggest giving them a shot. Even if you're like myself, and haven't enjoyed other immersive sims such as Bioshock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I would be remiss if I didn't mention Arkane Studios has recently announced their next project titled "Deathloop" which seems to revolve around two characters stuck in a sort of groundhogs day situation and the only way to end it is to kill the other. I'm very much looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Arkane Studios"></category></entry></feed>
