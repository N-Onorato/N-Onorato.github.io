    <p>Earlier this year I played through Prey (2017) twice and watched my SO play through it once. It's obvious that I love the game and when a game has such an impact I like to examine who made it. As it turns out Arkane Studios, the creator of prey is also the studio behind many other games I've enjoyed such as the games in the Dishonored series.</p>
<p>People refer to their games as <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/immersive-sim/3015-5700/">immersive sims</a> which define the goals of the game. Typically these games emphasize variety in choice, story telling, and interaction. One reason I love Arkane's games is the varety of their world building. Here's a list of all the ways they build up a world from the top of my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Text logs found throughout the world, ranging from stories, poems, and any other things that might be written down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audio logs which are usually used for story exposition but also character building and things like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common conversations between NPCs can often be interesting and give interesting info about the world of their disposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall environment also tells a lot about the world. Including things like graffiti and NPCs routine animations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One area Arkane Studios hasn't explored too deeply is in the area of video. This makes sense as it's more work and if things change it's easier to re-record some audio or change some text. But I do remember them included 2 stylized "found footage" videos in Prey which added a fun sense of depth to the info.</p>
<p>With all that being immersive sims are just a style of game. The real success is in Arkane being able to design and execute that style with a compelling story and refined gameplay. If you haven't played Dishonored or Prey I would suggest giving them a shot. Even if you're like myself, and haven't enjoyed other immersive sims such as Bioshock.</p>
<p>Also I would be remiss if I didn't mention Arkane Studios has recently announced their next project titled "Deathloop" which seems to revolve around two characters stuck in a sort of groundhogs day situation and the only way to end it is to kill the other. I'm very much looking forward to it.</p>
