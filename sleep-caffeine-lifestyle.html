  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Most people don't have a healthy sleep schedule, but I don't think it's their fault. Keeping a healthy sleep schedule is hard and society doesn't facilitate good habits. By now most people know good sleep can keep us more alert, reduce stress, and reduce our risk for diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Unfortunatly the recipe for a good nights sleep is involved.</p>
<p>You'll need to...
* Avoid caffeine almost entirely, even small amounts of caffeine can disrupt sleep and it sticks around in your blood for a long time.
* Don't drink or eat before bed, having to get up to pee in the middle of the night disrupts your sleep.
* Sleep in a cool room because it facilitated higher quality sleep and quicker sleep onset.
* Don't interact with screens or strong light sources an hour before bed. This allows melatonin to be released and prepares us for sleep.
* Only sleep and have sex in your bed, no sitting there on your phone or watching TV. This conditions your body that you're about to go to sleep, facilitating the process.
* Go to bed and wake up at consistent times. The bodies circadian rhythm is fairly consistent and should be respected.
* Get regular exercise, this one may or may not directly help but it's a good idea as it keeps your body and brain functional.</p>
<p>Individually each of these is achievable, but collectively they represents a big change in our habits. Avoiding caffeine is difficult because it's pervasive in society and a lot of products contain it. It's socially acceptable to use coffee as a stimulant throughout the day and even consume it in Sodas later in the day. These drinks are also delicious, Starbucks has some amazing drinks/milkshakes and it's unfortunate that good sleep requires almost completely forgoing these drinks. </p>
<p>Beyond just changing our diets, good sleep requires us to keep a longer and more strict bedtime routine than most of us are used to. This starts with cutting off food and drink an hour or two before bed. Followed by an hour of dim-light where our activities are limited to reading, board-games, and whatever else can be done in dim light. Hopefully we have some way of automating a cool room for ourselves otherwise that will need to be done. Then finally we can lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>Two difficulties with this routine exist. The first is avoiding screen-time, at home we have large TVs, our phones, and computers all calling our for our attention. Everyone likes watching their favorite show at night and probably check any notifications from their phone as it comes in. In fact many people end their day laying in bed looking at their phone, almost he exact opposite of what should be done.  </p>
<p>The second problem involves sleeping in a cool room. Most houses built in the united state are insulated buildings with a central air conditioner. Most responsible people are conscious of their energy usage and realize how inefficient it would be to cool their house to sleep comfortably. Unfortunately most houses have no passive cooling technologies, can't target their cooling, and lack small air conditioners installed in a single room.</p>
<p>With all that being said these conditions represent the ideal in terms of sleep quality. They do not all need to be completed before a persons sees a benefit. Even removing screen time 30 minutes before sleep would be helpful and lead to higher quality sleep.</p>
