    <p><em>Insert a completely original and interesting image of a child looking at a phone or tablet here. It'll be totally interesting to look and a worthwhile introduction to the article</em></p>
<p>So I use pocket, a service backed by Mozilla that helps me collect articles I want to read from around the internet and store them in one place. It also makes recommendations from articles other people are reading. One of these articles was from Outsideonline.com titled "The Best Book Yet on Parenting Screen Addicted Kids". The article is by Jacob Baynham and consists of Baynham reflecting on what the lessons they took away from the book "Raising Humans in a Digital World" by Diana Graber. First off I'd just like to mention that despite the title of Baynham's article it's not about kids actually dealing with any kind of addiction to technology. Instead it's about how to raise a kid in a world where a harmful amount of time can be spent on screens.</p>
<p>Overall the article is ok and I'd recommend you give it a read and think for yourself. But there's one large point that bothered me in this article and often bothers me when it comes to this topic. Most discussions around screen time are focused on limiting kids time on a screen. This might seem appropriate but it's not, the fear of screens is that kids will miss out on other more valuable and enriching things. Screen time is only harmful if it reduces other activities like spending time with the family, socializing with friends, or doing other worthwhile tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the article promotes some of the strange ways people try and forcibly reduce screen time. Such as setting technology free zones such as bedrooms or technology free times. Even encouraging fasts from technology for a day or two. I cannot imagine these would be successful strategies as it makes technology a thing to be desired. Something they want but can't have, which makes it all the more valuable. It doesn't seem like a way for kids to learn to use technology responsibly. that being said there's nothing wrong with encouraging kids to track and keep a perspective on how much time they spend using technology. But the focus should be an spending time with your kid and making sure they do other things besides screen time.</p>
<p>Lastly, the article talks about the harms of social media along with screen time which in my opinion overly complicates the article. Screen time is a generalized term and when kids are on it some level of parental control should be used. The discussion of social media is a separate more complicated issue. It would've been better to not touch on that or to write a separate article talking about how kids should be introduced and encouraged to use social media if they are to use it at all.</p>
