    <p>Recently there was an opinion post in The Washington Post by M.R. O'Connor titled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ditch-the-gps-its-ruining-your-brain/2019/06/05/29a3170e-87af-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html">Ditch the GPS. It's ruining your brain.</a> and as someone with a neuroscience background this caught my attention. Plenty of things such as video games and social media were said to rot and ruin your brain but that's rarely been the case. The brain might change, but outside of damaging it or developing a disease it wont be ruined. The main thrust of the article seems to focus on the idea that using GPS can decrease hippocampal gray matter and that for some reason this is bad. O'Connor begins by extolling the usefulness of GPS before diving into how it affects perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people are told which way to turn, it relieves them of the need to create their own routes and remember them. They pay less attention to their surroundings. And neuroscientists can now see that brain behavior changes when people rely on turn-by-turn directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is completely true and not at all surprising. When doing an activity differently or being assisted by technology we would expect the brain to behave differently simply because it's doing something different than it did before. So far things are fine, but as we see later on O'Connor confuses gray matter volume with overall function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies have long shown the hippocampus is highly susceptible to experience. (London’s taxi drivers famously have greater gray-matter volume in the hippocampus as a consequence of memorizing the city’s labyrinthine streets.) Meanwhile, atrophy in that part of the brain is linked to devastating conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. Stress and depression have been shown to dampen neurogenesis — the growth of new neurons — in the hippocampal circuit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where I think O'Connor gets confused. The hippocampus and the brain in general adapts to the tasks it's being used for. This is called brain plasticity and it's an important part of learning. Increased size can indicated better navigational performance but so what? Most people's hippocampi have adapted to the tasks their being asked for, not everyone is a taxi driver in london.</p>
<p>O'Connor also seems to suggest having a small hippocampus is bad by linking it to post-traumatic stress disorder and alzheimer's. This isn't correct, the brain in a disease state might experience pathological changes due to the disease. These can cause functional problems because the individual still requires those skills.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the study that this article is based on which was led by Véronique Bohbot also seemed to suggest a larger hippocampus is better saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we are paying attention to our environment, we are stimulating our hippocampus, and a bigger hippocampus seems to be protective against Alzheimer’s disease,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After looking at the study this isn't an accurate reflection of the research. The research shows that lower hippocampal volume is a risk factor for Alzheimer's but this relationship isn't understood. This isn't evidence that increasing hippocampal volume would protect you from alzheimer's. It's far more likely that whatever environmental, genetic, and behavioral conditions lead to alzheimer's also tend to allow for lower hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate to see these kinds of articles picked up. There's likely an interesting story about what roles the hippocampus plays in navigation and how these differ between individuals. Instead we get throw away articles about GPS rotting your brain from a respected publication. Slapping an opinion tag doesn't give The Washington Post a pass either. They are providing a platform and should ensure it's content is at least objectively true.</p>
