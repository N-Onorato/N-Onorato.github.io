  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Imagine you've spent your entire life in a house with no windows or doors to the outside world. All your needs were taken care of, people stopped by mysteriously, food was delivered, and things magically got cleaned. Then imagine after living years like this the door opened, and you had access to the entire world. But also imagine it's winter and not all that nice outside. You could venture outside and look around at this new world but would you?</p>
<p>Personally I find the answer obvious, of course I would explore this new world. I would ask why things had changed, am I intended to leave the house now or has there been a mistake? Initially, I think I would explore the world due to fear. I would want to know if my peaceful, stable life was coming to and end or was under threat by a bulldozer outside my door.</p>
<p>If after investigating the outside and determining there was no threat and observed things carrying on as normal, would I still choose to go outside? This is where the idea of curiosity comes in. What would propel me to explore the world? Is curiosity simply a sense and desire to understand the world for it's own sake? Maybe curiosity only exists because we have fears such as famine, mortality, and the unknown. We seek out understanding so that we can later manipulate the world to mitigate our fears. From my own head I can't work out the answers to these questions. But there are people in my life who seem to lack any kind of curiosity. Perhaps these people will provide us with some answers as to the nature of curiosity.</p>
<h3>People without curiosity?</h3>
<p>I've run into multiple people in my life that seem to have no curiosity. What does that mean exactly? I mean they take no interest in understanding the world around them from the way financial institutions are setup to the types of spiders they kill in their homes. From my experience these individuals live their lives reactively and through ignorance. If they want a credit card they will seek out just enough information to get one. They will not however learn the best practices of using one, how it affects their credit, or a cards associated benefits. I also want to be clear these behaviors aren't inherently bad. Most people avoid researching certain things and get along in life just fine. In fact its impossible to learn about everything, the behavior I'm talking about applied to almost all topics. These people rarely have interests and live their lives primarily through habit. I am confident these people would not leave the house after assuring themselves that it wasn't in danger.</p>
